These are notes for myself, and anyone that would like to use them, that go into the S-matrix in all of its vastness. This started from my, initially, poor understanding of scattering matrices and how analyticity, unitarity, causality, and crossing relations fit into the S-matrix, and so I decided to teach myself from various sources the material--the best way for me to do that is via writing my own ``lecture notes.''
